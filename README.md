# Computer Architecture 
Problems from course **Computer Architecture** I attended on [Politechnika Wroclawska](https://wiz.pwr.edu.pl/en/)  
All problems are solved using **MIPS Assembly** language.  
  
To run MIPS Assembly [MARS MIPS simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) was used.  
MIPS Assembly [instruction set](https://www.dsi.unive.it/~gasparetto/materials/MIPS_Instruction_Set.pdf).
